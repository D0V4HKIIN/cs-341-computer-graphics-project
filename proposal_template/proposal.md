# Goals and Deliverables

Describe the goals of your project here, following the
[project instructions](https://lgg.epfl.ch/teaching/ICG2019/icg_lectures/2019_project_instructions).

# Schedule

Specific plan on when and by whom tasks will be completed.

# Resources
We consider making the demo in Godot, a open-source game engine. Alternatively we also could use three.js, a javascript/webgl based framework.
We believe that in order to make our project look really realistic and interactive, the above frameworks will work better than pure WebGL.
