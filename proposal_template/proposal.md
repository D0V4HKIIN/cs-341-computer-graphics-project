# Summary

The goal of the project is to create an interactive scene of a boat floating in the ocean. More specifically, we want to be able to have an infinite ocean, dynamically change the weather conditions (calm sea vs storm), steer the boat and ideally have realistic water-boat interactions, such as wave generation and water spashes.


# Goals and Deliverables

Describe the goals of your project here, following the
[project instructions](https://courses-gcm.epfl.ch/icg2023/project/instructions/).

Core project:

 * Wave generation: height and frequency of waves, simulating different waves under various weather conditions (make interactive).
 * Boat that you can steer.

Extras:
 * Sun reflections on waves.
 * White water foam on waves, that depend on the weather condition (research on formulas).
 * The realistic boat-water interaction.


# Schedule

Specific plan on when and by whom tasks will be completed.

# Resources
We consider making the demo in Godot, a open-source game engine. Alternatively we also could use three.js, a javascript/webgl based framework.

We believe that in order to make our project look really realistic and interactive, the above frameworks will work better than pure WebGL.
